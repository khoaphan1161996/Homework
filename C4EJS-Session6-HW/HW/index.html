        "Mary Oliver is saving my life." Paul Chowder, the title character of Nicholson Baker's novel "<a href="#">The Anthologist.</a>" scrawls in the margins of Oliver's "<a href ="#">New and Selected Poems, Volume One.</a>"A 
        struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case of writer's block. His girlfriend, with whom he's lived for eight years, has just left him, ostensibly because he has been unable to write the 
        long-overdue introduction to a poetry anthology that he has been putting together. For solace and inspiration, he turns to poets who have been his touchstones — Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke,
        Sara Teasdale — before discovering Oliver. In her work, he finds consolation:"I immediately felt more sure of what I was doing". Of her poems, he says, "They're very simple. And yet each has
        something."

    <p style="margin-left: 30px;"> I don't know exactly what a prayer is.
        <br>I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down
        <br>into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,
        <br>how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,
        <br>which is what I have been doing all day.</p>

         The cadences are almost Biblical. "Attention is the beginning of devotion," she urges elsewhere.
